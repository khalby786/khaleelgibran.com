  <h3>where you can find me</h3>
  <p>
    I usually go by the <a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moniker"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">moniker</a
    > <code>khalby786</code> or <code>thepixelatedonut</code> on the Internet.
  </p>

  <p>
    I publish all my open-source code on <a
      href="https://github.com/khalby786"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a
    >. I usually create small projects, proofs-of-concept or small static sites
    that don't require much work on
    <a
      href="https://glitch.com/@khalby786"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Glitch</a
    >. However, if I feel like trying out CSS or recreating stuff I see on the
    Internet with CSS,
    <a
      href="https://codepen.io/khalby786"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">CodePen</a
    > is the place to go.
  </p>

  <p>
    I like offering people the luxury of being able to contact me in more than
    one way, in case they ever need to get a hold of me (hey, you never know!).
    I usually hang around pretty much all the time on <a
      href="https://discord.com/users/634701839983706112"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a
    >.
    <a
      href="https://instagram.com/khalby786"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a
    >
    is where my friends tag me on cringe posts and
    <a
      href="https://twitter.com/khalby786"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a
    >
    is where <strike>I post my thoughts on life and stuff</strike>(shush, GitHub
    Copilot) I desperately need followers.
